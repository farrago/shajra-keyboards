* Org-mode Setup                                                   :noexport:

This snippet is just used by Emacs's org-mode to crop down results:

  #+NAME: crop
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var text="" :var first-n=5 :var last-n=5 :results silent :exports none
  (let* ((ls       (split-string text "\n"))
         (first-ls (mapconcat 'identity (-take first-n ls) "\n"))
         (last-ls  (mapconcat 'identity (-take-last (+ 1 last-n) ls) "\n")))
    (concat first-ls "\nâ€¦\n" last-ls))
  #+END_SRC

This puts the build into a consistent-enough state.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent :exports none
   nix build
   nix-collect-garbage
  #+END_SRC

* About the Project

  This project has the "shajra" keyboard mappings for two ergonomic split
  keyboards:

  - [[keyboardio][Keyboardio's Model 01]], programmed with [[kaleidoscope][Kaleidoscope]] firmware.
  - [[ergodox-ez][ZSA Technology Labs' Ergodox EZ]], programmed with [[qmk][QMK]] firmware

  Beyond the keymap, this project offers some streamlined automation with [[nix][Nix]]
  that you can use for your own keymap.

  The rest of this document discusses using this automation. To get the most
  out of the keymap itself, you may be interested in the [[file:doc/design.org][design document]]
  explaining the motivation behind the mapping.

* The mappings

  The "shajra" keymaps for both keyboards are extremely similar, which works
  out well because the physical layouts of these keyboards are also similar. We
  can more easily switch from one keyboard to another, and retain the design
  benefits of the mapping.

*** Model 01 "shajra" keymap

*** Ergodox EZ "shajra" keymap

    [[file:doc/ergodox-ez-shajra-layout.png]]

* Using these key mappings

  This project only supports a GNU/Linux operating system with the [[nix][Nix package
  manager]] installed.

  QMK and Kaleidoscope have build complexities and dependencies that can take a
  moment to work through. Nix can automate this hassle away by downloading and
  setting up all the necessary third-party dependencies in way that

  - is highly reproducible
  - won't conflict with your current system/configuration.

  By using Nix, we won't have to worry about downloading QMK or Kaleidoscope,
  or making sure we have the right version of build tools like Arduino
  installed, or messing with Git submodules, or setting up environment
  variables. Nix does all this for us. The provided scripts simplify using Nix
  even further.

  The following steps will get your keyboard flashed.

*** 1. Install Nix on your GNU/Linux distribution

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    *_NOTE_*: You don't need this step if you're running NixOS, which
    comes with Nix baked in.
    #+END_QUOTE

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    *_NOTE_*: Nix on Macs (nix-darwin) currently won't work with this
    project and is not supported for Macs.
    #+END_QUOTE

    If you don't already have Nix, the official installation script should work
    on a variety of GNU/Linux distributions. The easiest way to run this
    installation script is to execute the following shell command as a user
    other than root:

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
      curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
    #+END_SRC

    This script will download a distribution-independent binary tarball
    containing Nix and its dependencies, and unpack it in =/nix=.

    If you prefer to install Nix another way, reference the [[nix-install][Nix manual]].

*** 2. Make sure your udev rules are set

    To program either keyboard with a new mapping, you need to augment your OS
    configuration with new udev rules.

    The following are recommended rules for each keyboard:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      # For Teensy/Ergodox
      ATTRS{idVendor}=="16c0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="04[789B]?",
      ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1", ENV{ID_MM_PORT_IGNORE}="1"
      ATTRS{idVendor}=="16c0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="04[789A]?",
      ENV{MTP_NO_PROBE}="1" SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="16c0",
      ATTRS{idProduct}=="04[789ABCD]?", MODE:="0666" KERNEL=="ttyACM*",
      ATTRS{idVendor}=="16c0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="04[789B]?", MODE:="0666"

      # For Kaleidoscope/Keyboardio
      SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1209", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2300",
      SYMLINK+="model01", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}:="1",
      ENV{ID_MM_CANDIDATE}:="0" SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1209",
      ATTRS{idProduct}=="2301", SYMLINK+="model01",
      ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}:="1", ENV{ID_MM_CANDIDATE}:="0"
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    These settings should correspond to the official documentation:

    - [[qmk-install][QMK documentation for configuring udev]]
    - [[kaleidoscope-install][Kaleidoscope documentation for configuring udev]]

    Each distribution is different, but on many GNU/Linux systems, udev rules
    are put in a file in =/etc/udev/rules.d= with a ".rules" extension.

    On some systems, you can activate these rules with the following commands:

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
      udevadm control --reload-rules udevadm trigger
    #+END_SRC

    Or just restart the computer.

*** 3. For Kaleidoscope, join the necessary OS group

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    */NOTE:/* You don't need this step if you're flashing the Ergodox EZ.
    #+END_QUOTE

    Once udev is configured, when you plug in the Keyboardio Model 01, a
    =/dev/ttyACM0= should appear. On many systems, this device is
    group-owned by the "dialout" or the "uucp" group:

    In the following example, we can see the device is group-owned by the
    "dialout" group.

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no :exports both
      ls -l /dev/ttyACM0
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 Nov 12 08:58 /dev/ttyACM0

    On most distributions, the follow commands should work to join a group
    (substituting =$TTY_GROUP= and =$USERNAME=):

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
      sudo usermod -a -G $TTY_GROUP $USERNAME
      newgrp $TTY_GROUP
    #+END_SRC

    You should see memberships in the new group with the =groups= command:

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output :exports both
      groups | grep dialout
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : users wheel video dialout docker

*** 4. Unplug and replug your keyboard

    Unplug your keyboard(s) and plug them back in, to make sure everything's
    set to program.

*** 5. Get the code and run it

    Clone this code base and go into the directory:

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
      cd $SOME_WORKING_DIR
      clone https://github.com/shajra/shajra-keyboards.git
      cd shajra-keyboards
    #+END_SRC

    Note, the first time you run the commands described below, you'll see
    Nix doing a lot of downloading and compiling. After that, subsequent
    invocations should be quicker with less output.

**** Flashing an Ergodox EZ keyboard

     You can run the following to flash your Ergodox EZ with the new keymap,
     pressing the reset button when prompted (access the reset button with an
     unbent paperclip inserted into the small hole in the top right corner of
     the right keyboard half):

     #+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
       ./flash-ergodoxez
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output :exports results
       head -11 < <(./flash-ergodoxez)
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     #+begin_example

**** Flashing a Keyboardio Model 01 keyboard

     You can run the following to flash your Keyboardio Model 01, holding
     down the =Prog= key and then pressing =Enter= when prompted:

     #+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
       ./flash-model01
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output :exports results
       head -14 < <(./flash-model01)
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     #+begin_example

     Flashing Keyboardio's Model 01 (custom "shajra" keymap)

     BOARD_HARDWARE_PATH="/nix/store/136z5dj3nnyn7gf9fx6i7xq4an3v7iz3-kaleidoscope-src/arduino/hardware" /nix/store/136z5dj3nnyn7gf9fx6i7xq4an3v7iz3-kaleidoscope-src/arduino/hardware/keyboardio/avr/libraries/Kaleidoscope/bin//kaleidoscope-builder flash

       - Program:   25566 bytes (89.2% Full)

     To update your keyboard's firmware, hold down the 'Prog' key on your keyboard,
     and then press 'Enter'.
     #+end_example

     The =Prog= key is hardwired to be the top-left-most key of the
     Keyboardio Model 01, but the =Enter= key can be remapped. If you forget
     where the =Enter= has been mapped to on your Keyboard, you can hit
     =Enter= on another connected keyboard.

* Reverting to the factory default mapping

  This project's scripts won't save off your previous keymap from your
  keyboard. But we can revert to the keymap that your keyboard shipped with.

  This can be done with the =-F=/=--factory= switch, which both
  =./flash-ergodoxez= and =./flash-model01= support. Both scripts have a
  =-h=/=--help= in case you forget your options.

* Modifying and testing

  The provided code is fairly compact. If you look in the [[./ergodox_ez/keymaps]]
  and [[./model_01/keymaps]], you should find familiar files that you would edit in
  QMK or Kaleidoscope projects, respectively.

  For both keyboards, The "shajra" keymap is in it's own directory. You can
  make your own keymaps and put them in a sibling directory with the name of
  your choice.

  Then you can use the =-k=/=--keymap= switch of either script to load your
  custom keymap by the name you chose for the keymap in the "keymaps"
  directory. The scripts should pick up changes, rebuild anything necessary,
  and flash your keyboard.

  Nix will copy your source code into =/nix/store=, and the invocation of both
  scripts will print out a "FLASH SOURCE:" line indicating the source used for
  compiling/flashing for your reference. These are the full source trees you'd
  normally use if following the QMK or Kaleidoscope documentation manually.

  If you want to check that everything builds before flashing your keyboard,
  you can run a =nix-build= invocation:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output :exports both
    nix-build --no-out-link
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  If you run =nix-build= without the =--no-out-link= switch, Nix will leave
  symlinks behind in your working directory that point to the built artifacts,
  which Nix always stores in a special =/nix/store= directory. The names of
  these symlinks are all prefixed with "result".

  You can garbage collect =/nix/store= by running =nix-collect-garbage=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent :exports none
    nix-collect-garbage
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent :exports none
    rm result*
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output :exports both :post crop(text=*this*)
    nix-collect-garbage 2>&1
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example
  finding garbage collector roots...
  deleting garbage...
  deleting '/nix/store/trash'
  deleting unused links...
  note: currently hard linking saves -0.00 MiB
  â€¦
  deleting garbage...
  deleting '/nix/store/trash'
  deleting unused links...
  note: currently hard linking saves -0.00 MiB
  0 store paths deleted, 0.00 MiB freed
  #+end_example

  The "result" symlinks generated by =nix-build= keep built artifacts from by
  garbage collected by =nix-collect-garbage=. Otherwise, these symlink are safe
  to delete, and [[./.gitignore][ignored by Git]].

* Release

  The "master" branch of the repository on GitHub has the latest released
  version of this code. There is currently no commitment to either forward or
  backwards compatibility. However the scripts for compiling/flashing are
  largely stable and are less likely to change than the "shajra" keymap.

  The "user/shajra" branch is a personal branch that is force-pushed to. The
  "master" branch should not experience force-pushes and is recommended for
  general use.
