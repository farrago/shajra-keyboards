You can safely ignore everything in this directory.

There are two scripts in this directory.

- =dependencies-update=
- =docs-generate=

They are designed to be called with no arguments, and can be called from any
working directory, though they both modify the source code in place.

=dependencies-update= updates the dependencies in [[../nix/sources.json]] with a
tool called [[niv][Niv]].

=docs-generate= will execute any ~SRC~ blocks in Org mode files, modifying them
in place. And then it generate GitHub Flavored Markdown files from them.

There's also a =setup.org= file with common setup for all the Org mode files in
this project.
